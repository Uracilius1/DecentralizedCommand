game name: Decentralized command. A text game with elements of strategy and mini games that puts you in the shoes of a soviet rifleman rising
through the ranks during the first world war.

Gameloop: 

	Static pre-battle screen:
		
		Dialogues with subordinates(autogenerated) (+-relations, +-initiative, +-confidence, +-loyalty, +-supplies)
		
		Edit current team/see team

		Dialogues with higher ups
	
	Battle screen: tilesize 16x16pixels(zelda-type sprites) 32 tiles high 24 tiles wide (768 tiles area)

	black tiles are obstacles(cannot pass)
	brown tiles are cover(bonus to defense)
	white tiles are walkable.
	grey tiles are elevation(bonus to spotting, chance to hit)
	

	Game runs in 30FPS, which means that game calculates several things per second:
	if the unit moved:
		their new position. Is calculated 30 times/second
	
	initiative roll (randint(30, 100) < (initiative+confidence)/2) calculated once every two seconds.

	if initiative roll is true, thread(game) is paused and the AI selects which action it wishes to make.

		Orders:

			if under fire, return fire;
			if under fire, place smokes;
			if under fire, retreat;
			
			if not engaged, try to flank enemy;(make angle with facing enemy at least 75 degrees)

			you also can command units by selecting buttons 1 to 4 and clicking the enemy to return fire/start firing, clicking the ground to move(if not under fire) or retreat(if under fire)
	
	engagement is also calculated every second:
			
		The following status effects have influence on the engagement:
			If flanking successful: +40% chance to hit an enemy every tick(minute)
			Otherwise flanking is unsuccessful and the enemy switches targets onto the flanking squad, which can be in the open, adding status modifier "Caught during maneuver"
				
				returning fire: base 20% chance to hit an enemy every tick. Chance to be hit + 10%
				Under fire: 15% chance to be hit every second, -5% chance to hit.
				Suppressed: +10% chance to be hit every tick, cannot move, 0% chance to hit enemy. To get out of this status-effect has to do confidence check
				Caught during maneuver: 30% chance to be hit every second
				Elevation: +10% chance to be spotted and spot, +10% chance to hit
				bleeding out!: triggered when health is 15% or less. Cannot move, can be moved into cover, needs medical assistance
				giving medical aid: cannot move, cannot fire. Chance to be hit +5%
				KIA: cannot move, cannot fire, cannot be hit
				In smoke: -20% chance to be hit every second, -20% chance to hit enemy.
				In cover: -10% chance to be hit every second
				retreating: no effects, cannot give orders for 10 seconds.
		
		every second status effects are calculated to be removed
		
		every two seconds time is assigned for status effects to also be added.




	there are your units and enemy units, enemy are highlighted in red. I have sprites ready for riflemen and officers. Email me if you want to see them.

	all units have AI assigned to them, that calculates their next move if they have orders to perform. Otherwise only engagements are calculated. This brings calculations amount
	to a safe minimum. 

The game's (current) goal is to survive at least five battles. I am in the process of creating a map analyzer(I give a .txt file with c, w, w, w, we, weh, ce)(cover, walkable, walkable elevated hostile etc)
that will display map from a single txt file. The game is about building relationships and delegating command to your good officers to survive engagements. I will attach a file. 
At the moment of writing, (3:39PM 1/18/2022) It has sprites to use, a main window utilised, and the commander can move around. This is to demonstrate that I am up to the challenge, and
actually interested in making this work.

Here are the things I will learn/reinforce knowledge of while doing this project:

2D sprite creation, animation,
AI combat pathfinding
AI combat behavior in general
OOP

I will also have some fun.
